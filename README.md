# Bortar
Bortar is a wine catalog, written as a dissertation, and extended as an excercise.

It's a simple PHP web project using MySQL, that lets you catalog your wines as you see fit. During development my goal was to make this project widely applicable. 
Popular personal applications like Delectable or Vivino are very useful for mobile use and for keeping track of your personal wine collection (although they really only work
well on mobile platforms), but small businesses have no use for them (except for the occasional advertisements). Desktop general purpose cataloging programs are be useful for
businesses, but not for the everyday wine enthusiast. The program that has gotten closest to merging the two concepts is Winebase, a desktop wine cellar inventory application,
that can be used for your personal collection and for small business inventory alike. However, it's stricly offline, and you can't use it in special applications like a
wine reserve or a winery's preorder system. Bortar tries to solve this problem by giving you an easy to use system, that you can set up and manage the available wines yourself,
or even for your customers.
